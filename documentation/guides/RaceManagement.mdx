Before you start.

## Getting Started
Once the terminal has loaded you will see a screen like this:

The list of races for today are shown on the screen.
The green “create new event” button can be used to create extra races.
Select the race you want to run.
You will see a page like the below.
 
Fill in the race information at the top with the duty team.
As Racers sign on with the terminal in the club house, they will appear on your screen. You can also add entrants with the “Add Entry” button.
When you are ready to start the race, tap the race panel button in the middle. Go to the section in this document for your race type.
## Handicap
You should see a Page Like the below.
  
Along the top bar is: A button to go back, the current race name, the current race time, the actual time, the start button.
The Green Start button is used to start the countdown procedure. The timer is set to 5:15 when you tap the button. The timer will begin counting down. The system will give you a countdown to the 5 mins. The hooter will self-hoot. As before, two timing devices should be used, so start a stopwatch at the 5 mins.
The second bar across the top contains the undo button, use this to undo your last action, and the three modes of operation. You can switch between these as you like during the race. Just tap one of the modes to switch to it.
If everything fails, record the actual time that a boat finished and send this with the results.
Once you tap start the green cards will have a lap button on them.
 
Tap the lap button as they do each lap. The cards will organise themselves so that the next boat through the line will be near the top of the page.
When you want to finish boats across the line, tap the “Finish Mode” button in the top right to change the lap button to a finish button.
 
When you finish boats, their card will go red. 
 
When everyone has been finished or retired a calculate results button will appear in the top right corner.
 
Tap this to calculate the results, this will also take you back to the home page and show you the results.
## Modifying Entrants mid-race
It is safe to tap the “back to home" button during the race to add new entries or modify attributes such as sail number.
## Pursuit
Your screen will look like the following.
 
Start race in the same way as a handicap race.
Tap lap as each boat comes through the start line, this will cause their position on the screen to change.
When the race time has ended the button in the top left will show submit results, tap this when the order shown is correct. This will take you back to the home page.
 
## The Stop button.
If you tap this there is a pop up asking if you are sure. Stopping the race will stop the timer, once stopped, you must reset the race, which resets the system to as if the race had not started.
This should be used for general recalls, individual recalls require no action on the system.
## Problems?

seek out another club member who may be more familiar with the system who can help you.

<br />
Along the top bar is: A button to go back, the current race name, the current race time, and the start button.\
The Green Start button is used to start the countdown procedure. The timer is set to 5:15 when you tap the button.\
The timer will begin counting down. The system will give you a countdown to the 5 mins. As before, two timing devices should be used, so start a stopwatch at the 5 mins.\
The second bar across the top contains the sorting mode option, the undo button, and the three modes of operation.
## Sorting Mode
There are two options for boat sorting: Dynamic on or off.\
When turned off the boats will remain in py order for the duration of the race, Fastest to Slowest.\
When dynamic sorting is on, the system will predict which boat will be next through the line and will sort them based on this. Thus, the next boats you need to action will be at the top of the screen.\
When in finish mode, the dynamic sorting will not shuffle the boats once one has finished, maintaining an order similar to the last lap.
## undo button
This will undo your last lap, retire or finish. There will be a pop-up to ensure you want to do your action.
## System Mode
You can switch between system modes as you like during the race. Just select one of the modes to switch to it.

## Retiring boats
Once this has been selected, a retire button will show next to each boat. Selecting this will bring up the following options.

<br />
Select the reason for retiring.
## Lapping boats
Tap the lap button as they do each lap. The cards will organise themselves so that the next boat through the line will be near the top of the page.
## Finishing boats
When you finish boats, their card will go red. 

## Calculating Results
 
When all boats have been finished or retired a calculate results button will appear in the top right corner, where the start/stop button was.
 
Tap this to calculate the results, this will also take you back to the race page and show you the results.
## Modifying Entrants mid-race
It is safe to tap the “back to home" button during the race to add new entries or modify attributes such as sail number.\
Returning back to race mode will remember where everything was.
<br />
# Pursuit
Your screen will look like the following.
 
Start race in the same way as a handicap race.
Tap lap as each boat comes through the start line, this will cause their position on the screen to change.
When the race time has ended the button in the top left will show submit results.\
Drag boats around to set their finish order. Select Submit Results when the order shown is correct. This will take you back to the home page.
 
## The Stop button.
If you tap this there is a pop up asking if you are sure. Stopping the race will stop the timer, once stopped, you must reset the race, which resets the system to as if the race had not started.
This should be used for general recalls, individual recalls require no action on the system.

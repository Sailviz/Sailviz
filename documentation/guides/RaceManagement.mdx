you can create a new event, by tapping the Create New Event Button. Practice mode allows you to try the system before the racing starts. There is also a button to test the horn

Fill in the race information at the top with the duty team. As Racers sign on to the race, they will appear on your screen. You can also add entrants yourself with the “Add Entry”
button. When you are ready to start the race, tap the green **Race Mode** button in the middle. If doing a pursuit race, please read both handicap and pursuit sections below.

<br />
Along the top bar is the current race name, the current race time, and the start button. The Green Start button is used to start the countdown procedure. The timer is usually set
to 5:15 for a single fleet race. When you tap the button the timer will begin counting down. The system will give you a countdown to the 5 minute signal. If the horn select switch
is in the 'auto' position, then the horn will sound automatically. As before, two timing devices should be used, so start a stopwatch at the 5 mins. The second bar across the top
contains the undo button, and the three modes of operation.

## undo

This will undo your last lap, retire or finish. There will be a pop-up to ensure you want to do your action.

## Retire a Boat

Once this has been selected, a retire button will show next to each boat. Selecting this will bring up the following options.

## Lapping boats

Once the race has started, a lap button will show next to each boat. Tap the lap button as they do each lap. The cards will organise themselves so that the next boat through the line will be near the top of the page.

## Finishing boats

When you need to finish boats, switch the system into finish mode by tapping the blue 'Finish Mode' button. This will show a finish button next to each boat. When a boat crosses the finish line, tap the button next to their name. When you finish boats, the card will go red to show they have finished.

## Calculating Results

When all boats have been finished or retired a calculate results button will show in the top right corner.

Tap this to calculate the results, this will also take you back to the race page and show you the results.

## Modifying Entrants mid-race

It is safe to tap the “back to home" button during the race to add new entries or modify attributes such as sail number.\
Returning back to race mode will remember where everything was.

## The Stop button.

If you tap this during the race there is a pop up asking if you are sure. Stopping the race will stop the timer, once stopped, you must reset the race, which resets the system to as if the race had not started. This should be used for general recalls only, individual recalls require no action on the system.

Your screen will look like the following.

This is very similar to the handicap race screen. Each card also shows which time the boat should start at.

Start race in the same way as a handicap race, by tapping the start button. Tap lap as each boat completes a lap. When the race time has ended the screen will change to show the boats in a table.

![Alt Text](/images/pursuit-ordering.png)

The order should be similar to the on-water order. Tap the up and down arrows to adjust the boats position. Tap Submit Results when the order shown is correct. This will take you back to the home page.
